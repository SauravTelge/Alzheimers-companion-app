He is looking slightly to his left with a casual, perhaps surprised or questioning expression.\\n\\nThe man on the right is wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt with the word \"MICHIGAN\" and a logo, indicating some affiliation with the University of Michigan or Michigan state. He is standing and is captured in the act of tilting his head back, drinking from a small cup or container held to his mouth with his right hand. His eyes are closed, and his expression can be interpreted as focused or pleasurable.\\n\\nIn the background, there are other individuals seated, also presumably dining, and various signs and notices attached to glass panels or walls.
